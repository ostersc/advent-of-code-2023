I want you to provide a kotlin based solution for an advent of code programming exercise.
I am going to paste the instructions, then a template source file I want you to fill out.
There will be two steps, first we need to get part1 solution correct,
then I will provide you part2's additional exercise which will build on the part1 problem.
You should never provide code that doesn't compile, if you are leaving placeholders they should be commented out.
The problems will provide sample input and the solution for it whenever the part is introduced so,
I always want your code to include that full input and the check to ensure it is correct.
I prefer you use kotlin idioms where possible.

here is the template:
fun main() {
    fun part1(input: List<String>): Int {
        return input.size
    }

    fun part2(input: List<String>): Int {
        return input.size
    }

   // test if implementation meets criteria from the description, supplying the
   // text from the problem description, and remove this comment
    val testInput = listOf(
        ???,
        ???
    )

    // modify these values once the part1 and part2 problem definitions provide the answer
    // to the testInput in the problem description and remove this comment
    check(part1(testInput) == 0)
    check(part2(testInput) == 0)

    // readInput is a utility to read the full input that is already defined
    // replace this comment and the "XX" with the current problem day
    val input = readInput("DayXX")
    println("Part 1 result: ${part1(input)}")
    println("Part 2 result: ${part2(input)}")
}
