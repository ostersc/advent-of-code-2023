Got part 1 on first try, had help it with several compiler errors for part 2, but it had no logic issues

Day 3:

Got both parts wrong on initial tries, but interestingly was able to correct both with little
to no logic input other than it being wrong.  It did need me to provide the full input to see
that there were more "symbols" than just the ones in the test input.
